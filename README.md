# world-wide-wishlist
Currently WIP. I want to make a unified wishlist chrome extension to which I can safe from any shop on the web. After Amazon Assistant went down, I need a working alternative.

# Notes
- console.log stuff so I can make sure stuff works! -> how error handling?
-

# Current Goal:
- put the images into a gallery that is also a form

# Future:
- Get the price of the item on the webpage and display it in the popup.html
- maybe make an "if" thingy for known/frequent webpages -> different file so I can add to that later
- change popup on save
- refactor scraping into scraper.js
- refactor to make a wish object
- refactor to make a wishlist object
