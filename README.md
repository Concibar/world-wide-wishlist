# world-wide-wishlist
Currently WIP. I want to make a unified wishlist chrome extension to which I can safe from any shop on the web. After Amazon Assistant went down, I need a working alternative.

# Notes
- console Log stuff so I can make sure stuff works! -> how error handling?

# Current Goal:
- create Wish Class

# Future:
- Make Button open mywishlist.html
- Get the price of the item on the webpage and display it in the popup.html
- maybe make an "if" thingy for known/frequent webpages -> different file so I can add to that later

# Success:

# 1: DONE implement a button that can be clicked and performs an action
- How do I get a button as a chrome extension that will open a thing and close said thing?

# 2:
- Get the title of the current tab and display it in the popup.html
