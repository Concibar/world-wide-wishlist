# world-wide-wishlist
Currently WIP. I want to make a unified wishlist chrome extension to which I can safe from any shop on the web. After Amazon Assistant went down, I need a working alternative.

# Notes
- do I need React/webpack/plasmo/a framework?
- I need to learn more Typescript :/


# Goals:

# 2:
- Make Button open mywishlist.html
- Get the title of the current tab and display it in the popup.html
- Get the URL of the current tab and display it in the popup.html

# 3:
- Get the price of the item on the webpage and display it in the popup.html
- maybe make an "if" thingy for known/frequent webpages -> different file so I can add to that later

# 4:
- Safe title, URL and Price to local


# Success:

# 1: DONE implement a button that can be clicked and performs an action
- How do I get a button as a chrome extension that will open a thing and close said thing?
