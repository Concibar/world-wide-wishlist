# Description
Tired of juggling multiple wishlists across various platforms? This is why I made World Wide Wishlist!

With World Wide Wishlist, you can consolidate all your desired products from any website into one place, effortlessly accessible from your browser. Whether you're a fan of niche boutiques, local shops, or mainstream retailers - everywhere you shop can now be neatly organized by hobbies, occasion or whatever you prefer.

But that's not all. All your data is securely stored on your Browser, ensuring your personal preferences remain confidential. You can easily transfer your data to another device.

Keep track of potential presents for friends and family, or simply remember essential household items like vacuum cleaner refills.
Even if the original shop disappears, your saved products remain safe and sound in your wishlist, ready for you to hunt them down elsewhere.

Features Summarized:
- One unified place for your wishes
- Top Privacy: only you have access to your data
- Organize your wishes however you like

World Wide Wishlist is free and has no ads, give it a try :)

# Feedback
I am most interested in hearing from websites that aren't working, bugs, errors etc.
I love feedback, although I am not currently planning any big feature updates. Pull requests are very welcome though and you are free to take the code and do whatever with it as long as anyone else can do the same with the result.
